There is a student app and a student class. Three objects are created and through paramaterised contructors and getters/setters the fields are filled. Each object asks the user to enter their name,course and email. 
The first object uses the default constructor and is created before asking for any information. The second object uses a constructor which is called after the user enters their name. The third object is created
after all information has been asked. The information is displayed at the end and a scanner takes all of the information typed.
