the getter/setters available in the Student Class to store and retrieve this information.
StudentApp should then prompt the user to enter another student name, then a student email, then the
name of the course the student is studying. StudentApp should use another instance of Student to store this
information by using a constructor that accepts a name and then populates the email and course by using
getter/setters available in the Student Class.
Finally, the StudentApp should then prompt the user to enter another student name, then a student email,
then the name of the course the student is studying. StudentApp should use another instance of Student to store
this information by using a constructor in the Student Class that accepts a name, email, and course.
